## üìå Future Architecture Outlook (Proposal)

![SmritiKosha Future Architecture](Arch.png)


# üí° Bonus Ideas for SmritiKosha (Scalable Add-ons)

## 1. AI Auto-tagging
Automatically generate memory tags based on image content using Vision APIs (e.g. Google Vision, AWS Rekognition). 
Trigger this as a background job after image upload.

## 2. Background Jobs / Queue Support
Use something like Supabase Edge Functions or a lightweight job queue (e.g. BullMQ) to process:
- image metadata extraction  
- deduplication hashing  
- AI classification  
- email sending

## 3. Public Memory Sharing
Allow users to make certain memories public (read-only) and generate shareable URLs:  
`smritikosha.app/m/memory-title`  
Optionally cache on CDN for speed.

## 4. Highlights & Collections
Let users group multiple memories into a ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù ‚Äî similar to Instagram story highlights.

## 5. Mobile App Support
Use the same backend API and offer a PWA or native app via Capacitor or React Native.

## 6. Analytics / Memory Stats
Track memory views, shares, most used tags ‚Äî and show personal insights.

## 7. Friends & Collaboration
Invite others to contribute to a memory (shared albums, stories, roadtrips).

## 8. Privacy Controls
Let users set visibility levels:
- Private  
- Friends-only  
- Public

## 9. Versioned Memories
Let users restore a previous version of a memory (title, tags, photos).

## 10. Commenting or Annotations (Optional)
Allow memory collaborators to comment on specific images or memories.
